# Analytic Question

1. Influential Commenter Analysis: What is the reach of a high-reputation user's comments? Find all users who have commented on the same recipes as the top 10 highest-reputation users. This can help identify which users are part of a key network.

2. Recipe Similarity Based on Users: What recipes are most similar to each other based on commenter overlap? For any given recipe, identify the top 5 other recipes that have the highest number of shared commenters. This could power a "users also commented on..." recommendation feature.

3. User-Recipe Commenting Paths: What are the most common paths a user takes when commenting on recipes? For example, do users who comment on baking recipes tend to also comment on a specific type of dessert recipe? This uncovers user behavior patterns.

4. "Tribe" Identification: Find clusters of users who have commented on a unique and highly similar set of recipes. This could be used to identify communities or "tribes" of users with shared interests, even if they don't directly interact.

5. Chain of Influence: Trace the user_reputation or thumbs_up scores through the network. For a specific high-reputation user, what is the average thumbs_up count of the comments on the recipes they have also commented on? This measures their indirect influence on a recipe's overall engagement.

6. Outlier Detection: Identify users who comment on a diverse range of recipes that have little to no commenter overlap with one another. This could point to users with eclectic tastes or those who are not part of any specific community.

7. Community Bridging: Find users who have commented on recipes from two or more distinct user "tribes." These "bridge" users are critical for connecting different parts of the community and could be influential.

8. Recipe Journey: Visualize the commenting journey of a new user. What are the first 5 recipes they comment on, and do those recipes share any common commenters or are they part of the same category?

9. Impact of High-Rated Comments: How does a 5-star comment from a high-reputation user affect subsequent commenting activity on a recipe? For a given recipe, what is the total reply_count and thumbs_up on comments posted after a 5-star comment from a high-reputation user?

10. Reputation Flow: How does user_reputation correlate across the network? What is the average user_reputation of all users who have commented on the same recipes as the top 10 most reputable users?
